# LMS is a learning management system, a platform for online education where students can learn on-demand skills.
The objective was to convert UML Diagram class models of the LMS into executable code.
I worked with my team to develop a structure for the application.
Each class diagram was developed into executable program in separate files on JavaScript.
Using principles of Object-Oriented Programming, inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism and encapsulation.
For each class, getters and setters where used to instantiate the methods and properties of the object.
